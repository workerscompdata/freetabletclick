          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
            The information provided by Free Tablet Click ("we," "us," or "our") on https://freetablet.click (the "Site") is for general informational and educational purposes only. All information on the Site is provided in good faith; however, we make no representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, adequacy, validity, reliability, availability, or completeness of any information on the Site. Your use of the Site and your reliance on any information on the Site is solely at your own risk.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-extrabold text-foreground mb-4 mt-12">2. No Guarantee of Eligibility or Approval</h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Our website provides guides and overviews of various public benefit pathways, such as the federal Lifeline program. Please be aware of the following:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-8">
            <li><strong>We do not process applications:</strong> We simply direct users to the official National Verifier or verified telecommunications providers.</li>
            <li><strong>We do not determine eligibility:</strong> Final eligibility is determined strictly by the USAC National Verifier and the participating wireless providers.</li>
            <li><strong>We do not distribute devices:</strong> Any devices, tablets, or broadband services are shipped and managed directly by the telecommunication company you choose to enroll with.</li>
            <li><strong>No guarantees:</strong> We cannot guarantee that you will be approved for a free or discounted device, nor can we guarantee the specific make, model, or condition (new vs. refurbished) of the device you may receive.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-extrabold text-foreground mb-4 mt-12">3. Affiliate and Advertising Disclosure (FTC Compliance)</h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            In compliance with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines, please assume that any links on this website leading to products or services are affiliate links. This means we may earn a small commission or referral fee if you click on a link and make a purchase or sign up for a service, <strong>at absolutely no additional cost to you.</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Furthermore, Free Tablet Click utilizes third-party advertising networks, including but not limited to <strong>Google AdSense</strong> and <strong>Ezoic</strong>, to serve display advertisements on our pages. These advertisements are automatically generated and are not necessarily endorsed by our editorial team. The compensation received from affiliates and ad networks allows us to maintain the site, conduct research, and provide this educational content for free. Financial relationships never influence our factual reporting.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-extrabold text-foreground mb-4 mt-12">4. Accuracy and Timeliness of Information</h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Government benefit programs are subject to frequent legislative and funding changes. For example, the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) ended due to a lack of federal funding. While we strive to keep our content meticulously updated for 2026, rules, state-level initiatives, and provider inventory can change overnight. We cannot be held liable for any outdated information, broken links, or policy shifts that occur after our content has been published. Always verify current program rules directly through the official USAC or FCC portals before submitting sensitive personal information.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-extrabold text-foreground mb-4 mt-12">5. External Links Disclaimer</h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
            The Site may contain (or you may be sent through the Site) links to other websites or content belonging to or originating from third parties. Such external links are not investigated, monitored, or checked for accuracy, adequacy, validity, reliability, availability, or completeness by us. We do not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of any information offered by third-party websites linked through the site. We will not be a party to or in any way be responsible for monitoring any transaction between you and third-party providers of products or services.

          <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-extrabold text-foreground mb-4 mt-12">6. Professional Advice Disclaimer</h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
            The Site cannot and does not contain legal or financial advice. The government program information is provided for general informational and educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional advice. Accordingly, before taking any actions based upon such information, we encourage you to consult with the appropriate professionals or government agencies.
